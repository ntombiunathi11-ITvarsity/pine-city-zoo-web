                        <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                        <p>Good materials to build insect hotels with can include using dry stone walls or old tiles. Drilled holes in the hotel materials also encourage insects to leave larvae to gestate. Therefore, different materials, such as stones and woods are recommended for a wide range and diversity of insect life. Logs and bark, and bound reeds and bamboo are also often used. The various components or sizes of holes to use as entry of an insect hotel attract different species. Ready-made insect hotels are also found at garden centers, and particularly ecological and educational conservational centers and organisations.</p>
                        <p>WHERE DO YOU GET THEM?</p>
                        <p>The best place to put an insect hotel is a sheltered area out of the wind around 5-8 feet off of the ground. Keep bug hotels in a place out of reach of dogs and cats and in an area that gets morning sun to prevent mold.</p>
