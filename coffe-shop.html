                        <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
                        <p>How important are our coffee drinking moments scattered across our day? We rest our happiness on them, and sometimes it feels like even our survival! So often, however, these meant-to-be sacred moments unhappily collide with butchered coffee made by uninspired or incompetent baristas. At Seattle we have worked hard to maintain the craft element of coffee. It is delicately preserved and nurtured as it journeys through the steps from bean to cup.</p>

                        <p>We have also put effort towards creating cafés and take-away kiosks that become urban refuges where you can escape, recalibrate and walk away strengthened to face another day in the city. We have trained our baristas to make your drinks just the way you like them – nipped, tucked and crafted to suit your individual taste. Our baristas are primed not just to satisfy our appetite for a great coffee, but for community and recognition as well. We hope that our slogan “the way you like it” isn’t just empty words, but sums up your whole experience in Seattle.</p>
                        <p>WHERE CAN YOU FIND IT?</p>
